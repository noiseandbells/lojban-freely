# ARGUMENT

An *argument* is an entity, usually a noun or pronoun, which acts or is acted upon as part of the action or state described by a [predicate](https://xextan.github.io/refgram/?page=predicate). In natural languages, we generally refer to the various arguments of a verb according to their role in the sentence: subject, object, and indirect object. In Xextan, these correspond the three core case roles O, E, and A, respectively. 

A complete sentence in Xextan technically requires only an illocution and a predicate, with the optional addition of one or more arguments (XBL.2), true adverbs (XBL.4), and/or prepositional phrases (XBL.6).
