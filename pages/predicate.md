# PREDICATE

A **predicate** is a verb which can be expressed as a function which takes one or more [arguments](?page=argument)

Predicates are the fundamental units of semantic meaning in Xextan, as in most logical languages. Xextan predicates include roots, compounds, freewords, and special predicates (particles with predicate grammar). All predicates have a predefined [[Case marker|case alignment]] which indicates the presence or absence of the O (nominative), E (accusative) and A (dative) case roles, and can be determined from the class to which the predicate belongs.

A predicate which immediately follows another predicate is treated as a descriptor which modifies the original predicate, with the two elements combining to form a single complex predicate called a serial. To avoid this behavior, it is necessary to separate the predicates by applying a terminator or operator.
