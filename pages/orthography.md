# Orthography

Xextan is written with the Latin alphabet. While a few alternative orthographies have been developed, there is not currently an “official” native script for the language, though this may be introduced at some point.

Unless otherwise specified, all predicates carry high pitch accent (or tone) on the initial syllable and low pitch on any trailing syllables, while particles carry low pitch. Any syllables which carry an irregular pitch for their shape is indicated by an acute accent á for high pitch, and a grave accent à for low pitch.

With the exception of y, which only occurs in names and loanwords (and only hypothetically, as there are currently no words in the dictionary which contain it), all vowels may additionally be nasalized, which is indicated in writing by placing a tilde above the letter, such as ã. Diphthongs may also be nasalized, in which case the mark is placed over the first vowel, as in ãu.

The only consonants permitted at the end (coda) of root words and root-shaped syllables are stops and sonorants, including /p/, /b/, /t/, /d/, /k/, /g/, /l/, /n/. Xextan does not phonemically distinguish voicing of syllable-final stops: in compounds, a syllable-final voiceless stop will assimilate its voicing to a following voiced consonant, except /l/ and /n/. 

Similarly, the nasal /n/ will assimilate its position to the following consonant, becoming /m/ before labial consonants and /ŋ/ before velar consonants. These sound changes are not reflected in the orthography, except where a stop forms a geminate or affricate with a following stop, in which case the syllable-final stop is written as its voiced counterpart.
