# Foreword

## *What is a logical language?* 

A logical language, or “loglang”, is a constructed language which can be translated to and from formal logic notation; or, more broadly, any language with an unambiguous syntactic structure, such that any given sentence has exactly one possible “reading”, and therefore may be easily parsed by an algorithm, something like a computer programming language. 

My language, **Xextan**, belongs to the latter, broader category; while it may not always translate perfectly to formal logical notation, it is designed to allow ideas to be expressed freely, simply, and unambiguously. While logical languages universally demand syntactic unambiguity, Xextan, like most, does not pretend at full semantic unambiguity, as this requires the titanic effort of creating individual words for every atomic concept known in natural language. 

The first logical language, Loglan, was created ostensibly in order to test whether an unambiguous language could encourage people to think and act more rationally. After the language developed a sufficiently large community, disagreements over basic flaws in the language's design resulted in a schism which culminated in the creation of Lojban, a language based on the same fundamental principle, and whose notoriety would one day eclipse its predecessor. 

Over time, many hapless idealists including myself found ourselves captivated by the utopian vision of Loglan and Lojban, and sought to master these bizarre and profoundly alien tongues for purposes equal parts intellectual and spiritual. Upon achieving such mastery, however, we found to our surprise that beneath the austere facade of logic and reason lay a language striking in its plainness, and burdened by deeply embedded flaws, limitations and oversights. 

We began to observe and understand these truths only after years spent in conversation, friendship, and and creative expression, through this, our beautiful language, the one we once thought to represent perfection in human communication. Many of us fell away from the effort out of frustration, lack of interest, or discouragement at the persistent gatekeeping and negativity which plagued the community from its inception. 

Yet those of us who would build ever upward, even knowing that our lofty goal remained unreachable, carried on in pursuit of the impossible dream. Unlike our predecessors, we found wisdom in the diversity of ideals and visions, and saw the folly that lurks in the pursuit of ultimate perfection. Most importantly, we discovered beauty and magic in the endless possibilities that lay before us as we gave form to pure imagination and weaved spirit into shapes and sounds.

This book, and the language which it describes, represents the culmination of my humble effort at achieving an impossible dream of my own. Dear reader, thank you for joining me on this journey. Above all I hope that through these pages I may pass along to you that same spark of inspiration that I found many years ago burning brightly in the dreams of another.
