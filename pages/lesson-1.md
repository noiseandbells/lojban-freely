# LESSON ONE: PREDICATES

Remember verbs? They’re those funny little words that tell us the action of a sentence. For example, “fall” and “hit” are verbs. Since verbs represent only an action, they need the addition of nouns to form a complete thought:

-	The leaf falls.
-	A car hits a tree.

However, if we remove the nouns from the above sentences, we are left with something that looks like a function, with blanks ready to accept a variety of nouns. 

-	**□ falls.**
-	The stone falls.
-	A bird falls.
-	Night falls.

-	**□ hits □.**
-	The bat hits the ball.
-	She hits herself.
-	Rain hits the ground. 

Lojban verbs, known as PREDICATES (Lojban: brivla), are formally defined in terms of their blanks, or PLACES. Collectively, the semantics and arrangement of PLACES in a PREDICATE is known as PLACE STRUCTURE.

In English, we sometimes refer to the PLACES of a verb with special names: we call the noun which performs the action the “subject” of the sentence, and the noun which receives the action the “object”. In Lojban, PLACES are instead designated with numerical X NOTATION according to the order in which they appear: x1, x2, x3, etc., up to a maximum five “slots”.

Lojban vocabulary is primarily comprised of ROOTS (Lojban: gismu). ROOTS are always five letters long, and follow two patterns: CVCCV (e.g. {cadzu}, “to walk”) or CCVCV (e.g. {plipe}, “to jump”). Besides ROOTS, PREDICATES also include COMPOUNDS and BORROWINGS.

In Lojban, verbs, nouns, adjectives, and adverbs are not distinct grammatical classes. These roles are played by PREDICATES. Though PREDICATES express a verb phrase, they may carry a semantic meaning which is more noun-like, such as {bolci}, “to be a ball”; or adjective-like, such as {xunre}, “to be red”.

To use a PREDICATE as a noun, we convert it to a noun by adding a DETERMINER, a type of PARTICLE (function word). These serve a similar purpose to “a(n)” and “the” in English.

The most basic DETERMINER is {lo}, which is more or less equivalent to the indefinite article “a(n)”. In simplest terms, for an arbitrary verb Q, {lo} converts the verb into a noun with the meaning “a Q-er” or “that which Qs”.
