# Morphology

Like most logical languages, Xextan words abide by the principle that “form follows function”. That is, different kinds of words may be easily distinguished by their shape. 

The most basic types of Xextan words are roots, which follow either a CVC or CCV pattern, with C representing consonants and V representing vowels. CVC roots must end in either p, t, k, l, or n, and CCV roots must contain a valid consonant cluster. Roots represent basic concepts which either cannot easily be described by reference to other basic concepts as or which are themselves useful in forming other words. In terms of semantic space, they correspond to verbs, nouns, and adjectives/adverbs in natural languages. However, all roots are are [predicates](?page=predicate) Examples of roots include:

**xen** 
(“become”)

**qlu**
(“yellow”)

**tsa**
(“plant”)

Roots can be chained together to form compounds, where the first syllable is pronounced with high pitch accent and all subsequent syllables with low pitch accent. While roots on their own tend to stand for their literal meaning unless otherwise specified, compounds are more opaque, and may be constructed from a generalization, analogy, or metaphor.

**vlabuk**				
“\[to be a\] dictionary”

**vla + buk**
“word” + “book”

**xutfli**
“\[to\] swim”					

**xut + fli**
“water” + “float”

**fengingop**			
“\[to be a\] queen”

**fen + gin + gop**
“female” + “family” + “govern”

The other types of words include particles, which serve special grammatical functions and take the form V, CV, and CVV, and freewords. Freewords include borrowed words and proper names (such as “Xextan”) and like roots and compounds, are grammatically predicates (see lesson 1). They cover all other valid word shapes besides predicates and particles.
